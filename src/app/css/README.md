## POSITION

1. Static Position - default position value for an element.

2. Relative Position -  you can move an element. not use for top,left,bottom,right position because it overlaps the residing elements. It is like sliding that sticker to a different spot without removing it from the paper. 

3. Absolute Position - You can use top,left,bottom,right position here because it is like lifting a sticker off a sheet of paper and placing it precisely where you want, regardless of where it was before.

4. Fixed Position -  It's "fixed" in place and doesn't move with the rest of the content

5. Stkcky Position -  It is a blend between relative and fixed. Imagine a sticky note on a long vertical ruler. As you slide the ruler up and down, the sticky note moves with itâ€”just like an element with position: relative;. But, when the top of the sticky note reaches a certain point (like the top edge of a window or frame), it sticks there and stops moving, behaving like position: fixed;.
